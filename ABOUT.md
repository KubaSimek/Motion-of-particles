# Simulation of the motion of 2D particles in a box

**Created by Jakub Å imek**

## Description of the problem

Create a Python program that animates a simulation of particles motion in a 2D box.
It should be possible to select particles of different sizes and masses, place the particles however we want in the box, and select the velocity of the particle in any direction.

The particles must move and bounce elastically from each other and from the walls.

Optimize the problem numerically so that it does not chop during the animation due to long calculations.
